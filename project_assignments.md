#CIS440 Project Assignments
The project is to be delivered in seven "releases" as well as a final report.  Requirements and grading criteria for each release are documented below.

##Release 0.1 (5pts, January 29)
On January 29, you must present an initial overview of the project to your classmates.  This will include crafting an initial README.md file, identifying the high level tasks to be completed this semester, and preparing paper mockups or digital prototypes to communicate the design goals.  The README file and prototypes should be committed to a GitHub repository, and the tasks should be entered into a waffle.io task board.  You will give a 5-10 minute presentation to your classmates.

##Release 0.2 (5pts, February 12)
By February 12, you are to have set up the "technology stack" for your project and integrated all the moving parts, so that it is possible to begin adding features.  For example, if you are creating a PHP/MySQL based website, you need to have set up the database and some of its tables, established a web hosting account, decided on a PHP version, and created at least one basic "hello world" page with links to a basic CSS file.  Determining a folder structure, and perhaps creating dummy files for pages yet to be developed, are also good ideas.  Commit the current version of your code to the GitHub repository.

This step is vital because it makes it possible to test and demonstrate new features.  With the technology stack in place, someone could make a change to the CSS (or something) and test it with all the other components working.  For full credit, you also need to provide a set of instructions for others to use your software.  I, or anyone else, should be able to follow these instructions to get your project up and running.  Therefore, in addition to your code, you need to provide information about how your server is set up, and you'll probably need to provide the SQL scripts to set up your database.  A sign of good design is that the list of instructions doesn't need to be too long!

Finally, in your presentation to the class, point out areas where you'd like classmates to help.

##Release 0.3 (5pts, February 26)
At this time, your project should be a "navigable" prototype that can be shown to potential users for their feedback.  The features don't need to be working, but you should have dummy pages in place and site navigation so that you can pretend to demonstrate most of the intended features.  You should also have a basic visual style (i.e. fonts and colors) although it doesn't need to be perfect -- just enough to have something people can give feedback on.

Carry out some "user testing" with at least 3 people (ideally, with intended customers or end users) to get some feedback on the usability of your software.  You might want to video their experiences with your product.  In your presentation to the class, tell us some of the feedback they gave you, and show us at least one specific change you have made as a result of this testing.

##Release 0.4 (5pts, March 12)
At this time, you should have some working features of your project coded.  I suggest you start with the core feature -- the one most important to the users -- and try not to get bogged down with login/logout or basic CRUD stuff, which can distract you for a long time.  Since this is Spring Break, instead of giving a classroom talk, please prepare a video demo.  This can be a re-visit of the "project overview" from Release 0.1, now including your improved understanding of the project and using your working prototype.  It can be 10-30 minutes long.  Put it up on YouTube, Vimeo, or some similar service, and provide a link to it in your README file.

##Release 0.5 (5pts, March 26)
By now your software should be substantially complete.  This is the time to get as many less-important features done as possible, and let your client know which features probably won't get done in this semester.  The client should be involved in determining these priorities and helping you decide what to include and what to defer.  You may want to start removing links to pages that aren't going to be finished, and generally polishing the details.

In your presentation to the class, show us the new features you have built, and convince the professor that you will be ready to "go live" in two weeks.  This is also a good time to make a final appeal for help from classmates.

##Release 0.6 (5pts, April 9)
This sprint should be mostly devoted to testing the software, fixing bugs, and completing the documentation, so that you can "go live" (at least to beta testers) on the day of the demonstration.  For full credit, implement some form of automated testing with at least 10 test cases, and demonstrate to the class how you run the tests and what the results are.  Also describe your plan for testing the site on live users, and how you will capture and use their feedback during the next 2 1/2 weeks.  The test cases, and the testing plan, should be documented in the GitHub repository.  I recommend you create a folder called 'tests' and keep these documents there.

##Relese 1.0 (10pts, tentatively April 28)
Give a public demonstration and presentation about your completed project.  This will be conducted as an "expo" for other students, faculty, staff, and friends of the Information Systems department to see your projects.  Each team will be provided with a table to set up their demo.  There will be easels available for displaying posters. I can't guarantee you'll be near a power outlet, so make sure your batteries are charged.  You should be prepared to give a good brief demonstration, and answer questions about:

- What feedback you received after going live, and how you responded to it.
- How the project evolved and changed during the course of development.
- What's the path going forward for this project, and what you might have done if you had had extra time.

I'll invite your clients/sponsors to the showcase, and after this event I'll give them a questionnaire to provide feedback that impacts your grade.  So give it a good effort!

##Project Report (10pts, April 30)
Prepare a report of at least 20 pages that tells the story of your successful project.  At a minimum, it should include the following:

- Title page, table of contents, and 1-page summary
- Identify the client, the problem, and the proposed solution
- Identify the team members
- Give an overview of functionality, actual and planned
- Describe the technology stack and any info needed to understand the code
- Describe your testing and evaluation activities and findings
- Tell us what's next for the software.  Did it go live?  Will it be developed further?

Feel free to embellish the report with graphics, code documentation, usage instructions, and other valuable information.  A major objective here is to have a "success story" that you can add to your portfolio and that I can share with other potential capstone project clients. 


#All Releases
In addition to specific milestones and deliverables above, all releases require the following for full credit:
- All tasks for previous releases must be complete.
- Task board must be updated to show what has been finished, and how the backlog has changed, since the previous release.
- README file and instructions for use must be up to date with any changes to the project.
- Code and other files should be committed to the GitHub repository.


#Extraordinary Projects
If your project is not a "typical" software development project, and some of the above milestones don't make sense, contact me directly for guidance on what to deliver and when.
